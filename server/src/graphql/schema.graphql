# GraphQL supports two basic types of request: queries and mutations. In both
# cases, you can specify the shape of the JSON you want to get back.
#
# This solves both the overfetching and underfetching problems that traditional
# REST and RPC APIs have: in one roundtrip, you get back exactly what you need,
# no more, no less.
#
# Queries and mutations behave similarly, except: on the server queries may be
# run in parallel, while mutations run one at a time. On the client, queries
# may use a cached response, while mutations always result in a request.

# Schema defines the GraphQL API

  # Returns the logged-in user making the query, or null if anonymous.
